This repository contains an implementation of RP verification, an integral part of the Data Verify Forwarder (DVF). The scripts housed here are packaged using `webpack` to ensure optimal transmission over the web. The comprehensive DVF source code is available [here](https://github.com/ARPSSO/arpsso.github.io) and deployed on [arpsso.github.io](https://arpsso.github.io). All code related to the DVF is openly available for public inspection and review to ensure its trustworthiness.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
